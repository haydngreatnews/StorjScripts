Personal Storj V3 Scripts

This is my personal script made to check up on my nodes with the new dashboard API, I based it off from a script made by @kevink on the storj forums. This script will only run on linux systems. 

For this script to run please ensure jq is installed on your system; run sudo apt install jq

How to use the script?

Simply call the script passing the server address first and then the port number of the API example;

./check.sh 192.168.0.1 14002

##192.168.0.1 is the address of the storj server and 14002 is the port number
